United States Geological Survey, or USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 

The earthquake data is visualized using a massive amount of data from all over the world each week using this tool published at https://deepakarnani.github.io/USGS_Leaflet_visualization/


   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes, here: (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) The data set to visualize being used is 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days'

 

A map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude shows data markers that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color. Popups provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   

To illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity, we pulled in a second data set and visualized it along side our original set of data. Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.
